# Flutter Splendid BLE Example App

This example application demonstrates the usage of the Flutter Splendid BLE plugin with the
following features:

- **Scanning for Nearby BLE Devices**: The application can scan for nearby Bluetooth Low Energy (
  BLE) devices. It provides a list of discovered devices, displaying their names and signal
  strengths.
- **Connecting to BLE Devices**: The application can establish a connection with a selected BLE
  device. It handles connection errors and timeouts gracefully.
- **Communicating with BLE Devices**: Once connected, the application can communicate with the BLE
  device. It can read and write to the device's characteristics, and subscribe to
  notifications/indications from the device.
- **Disconnecting from BLE Devices**: The application can disconnect from a connected BLE device. It
  also handles disconnections initiated by the device or due to signal loss.

This example application provides a comprehensive demonstration of the capabilities of the Flutter
Splendid BLE plugin. It serves as a great starting point for developers looking to integrate BLE
functionality into their Flutter applications.
