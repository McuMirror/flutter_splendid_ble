/// connection states and device conditions:
///
/// - A device is connected and the UI reflects the connected state
/// - The connection state changes after the route is loaded, and the UI updates accordingly
///
/// The tests use a fake implementation of the [CentralPlatformInterface] to simulate Bluetooth state transitions
/// without requiring actual BLE hardware.
///

///
/// ```bash
/// cd example;
/// flutter test integration_test/screens/device_details/device_details_route_test.dart
/// ```
