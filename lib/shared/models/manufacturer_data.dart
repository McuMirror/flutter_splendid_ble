/// Represents manufacturer data from a BLE device.
///
/// Manufacturer data is a specific type of data that can be included in the advertisement packets
/// sent by Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. This data is used to provide additional information
/// about the device, which can be useful for identifying the device or understanding its capabilities.
///
/// The manufacturer data is divided into two main parts:
///
/// 1. **Manufacturer Identifier**: The first two bytes of the manufacturer data represent the
///    identifier of the manufacturer of the device or the Bluetooth radio. This identifier is
///    assigned by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) and is unique to each manufacturer.
///    It helps in identifying the manufacturer of the BLE device.
///
/// 2. **Manufacturer-Specific Payload**: The remaining bytes of the manufacturer data are available
///    for the BLE device firmware to use according to the designer's purposes. This payload can
///    contain any data that the device wants to advertise, such as sensor readings, device status,
///    or other custom information. Interpreting this data generally requires documentation or some
///    other reference about the firmware implementation, as it is specific to the device and its
///    manufacturer.
///
/// This class encapsulates the manufacturer data and provides a structure for handling it within
/// the application.
