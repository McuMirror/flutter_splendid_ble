import 'ble_server_configuration.dart';

/// Represents a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) server for a Flutter application.
///
/// This class encapsulates the functionality needed for a Flutter app to act as a BLE peripheral device. It allows
/// the app to advertise BLE services, handle connections, and manage data exchanges with connected devices.
///
/// Usage:
/// - Construct a `BleServer` with the desired configuration.
/// - Use `startAdvertising()` to begin advertising the BLE services.
/// - Listen for incoming connections and disconnections via `onDeviceConnected` and `onDeviceDisconnected` streams.
/// - Implement `onReadRequest` and `onWriteRequest` to handle read and write requests from connected devices.
/// - Use `notifyConnectedDevices` to send data to connected devices.
///
/// This class acts as a high-level interface for the underlying platform-specific BLE peripheral capabilities. It
/// abstracts the complexities involved in managing BLE operations, providing a streamlined way for Flutter apps to
/// interact with BLE technology.
