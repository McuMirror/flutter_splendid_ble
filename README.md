A comprehensive Flutter plugin for interacting with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. This plugin
provides functionalities such as scanning for BLE devices, connecting to them, managing the bonding
process, writing to their characteristics, and disconnecting from them, among other features.

> ## Plugin Status
> **Work in Progress**
>
> This plugin is a work in progress. There are missing features, documentation that needs to be 
> added or updated, error handling that needs to be implemented, and parts that may make those 
> who went to college for computer science feel offended.

## Main Goals:

1. **Efficient Toolset**: The primary objective is to provide developers with an efficient set of
   tools for BLE interactions, reducing the need to rely on multiple libraries or native code.

2. **Best Practices**: The plugin is developed following all Flutter and Dart best practices,
   ensuring smooth integration into any Flutter project and consistency with the broader Flutter
   ecosystem.

3. **Best-in-class Documentation**: Good software should be accompanied by excellent documentation.
   As such, every class, variable, and method in this plugin is accompanied by detailed and
   easy-to-understand documentation to aid developers at all levels in leveraging the full potential
   of this plugin.
