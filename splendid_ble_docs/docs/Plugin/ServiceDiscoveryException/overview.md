# Overview for `ServiceDiscoveryException`

## Description

Exception for handling errors during the BLE service discovery process.

 This exception is thrown when an error occurs during the process of discovering services
 on a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) peripheral. The BLE service discovery process is a critical
 step in BLE communication, which involves querying a BLE peripheral for the services
 it supports. An error in this process typically indicates a problem with the BLE connection,
 the peripheral device's state, or an issue with the mobile device's BLE stack.

 The `ServiceDiscoveryException` contains a [message] that provides details about the
 failure, which can be used for debugging purposes or to inform the user about the nature
 of the issue.

  ## Example
 Below is an example of catching and handling a `ServiceDiscoveryException`:
 ```dart
 try {
   // Code to start service discovery on a BLE peripheral
 } on ServiceDiscoveryException catch (e) {
   // Handle the service discovery exception, possibly by alerting the user or retrying
   print(e.message);
 }
 ```

## Dependencies
