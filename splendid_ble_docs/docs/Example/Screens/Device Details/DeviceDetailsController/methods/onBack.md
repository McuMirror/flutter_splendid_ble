# Method: `onBack`

## Description

Handles taps on the [AppBar] back button.

 This button navigates back to the home page but it does not disconnect the Bluetooth device. Normally doing this
 would not make a ton of sense, but for the purposes of this example app, it is a useful feature.

## Return Type
`Future<void>`
